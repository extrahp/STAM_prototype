Scene 1

[start off with flashback of young kuro meeting a white spirit]
[flashback end, cut back to current time. Kuro is in the training field, standing before a massive tiger spiritual beast that suddenly appears before him]
[Kuro is feeling like this situation is completely ridiculous]
Kuro: [pants for a bit] Damn it, gimme a break!!
Kuro: He’s gonna blow up this whole place!
[Tiger roars]
Kuro: Nobody’s expecting ME to deal with this, right?
Kuro: [calling out to the temple] Hey Gen! We’ve got a... [looks over the giant tiger]... small problem here!
[shot of gen leaning behind the wall, hidden from Kuro]
Kuro: Aw come on! Hey anybody home!? The hell are you doing right now!? [Dodges an explosion] HAVE YOU GONE DEAF OR SOMETHING OLD MAN?
[Distance screaming]
[dodge an attack]
Kuro: Tch... damn it, looks like I’ve got no choice!
Kuro: [looks up to tiger] Okay then, let’s go!

[Kuro and the spirit fight.]
[As kuro fights intense battle, camera pans to gen peacefully drinking tea, Gen takes notice of Kuro’s battle]
Note: The following are special battle lines Kuro says in the battle.
Kuro: Hold on a sec... is it just me or are my attacks not even leaving a mark...?
[Spirit fires a bunch of fireballs at kuro]
Kuro: Aw crap! [Puts his hands out to protect himself]
[A fireball knocks into Kuro’s hands, and remains there]
[Kuro notices that he is now holding the fire ball, but it vanishes away quickly]
Kuro: [grunts from impact into his hand] Gnnngh!
Kuro: Wait, huh?
[Kuro looks into his hand, realizing something, and comes up with a plan]
Kuro: Hey buddy, why dontcha throw me some more of those fireballs again! RIGHT HERE!
Kuro: UH OH... NO NO NO NO~!
[Kuro tries to act out his plan, but isn’t given the chance to]
Kuro: Heh...I’m not done yet... as long as I can still move, I’ll take you down!
Kuro: I didn’t train for 6 damn years just to die here!
Kuro: BRING IT ON! HUUUARRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHH
[The crystal inside Kuro resonates, and Kuro feels a surge of power]
Kuro: [feeling the power] !!!
Kuro: [With his final bit of strength left, he gives it all] Here, this is yours!!!!!
[Battle ends in smoke from an explosion made by the fireball, kuro is knocked back into the ground]
[The fading smoke reveals the tiger spirit still there]
[screen fades to black, words across screen]
Tiger: This one’s got quite the potential, doesn’t he... Gen? Not to mention, inside this boy…
Scene 2
[Scene of gen walking to Kuro]
[Kuro wakes up a while later, and notices Gen standing by some rubble, it’s still night time, the moon shines brightly]
Kuro: [Wakes up, groans] G-gen...?
Gen: [Sarcastic excitement] Wow look at that! You actually fought it off!
Kuro: Huh..? Wait, where’s the tiger? Did I beat it?
Gen: Hmph. You’re lucky little Byako let you off easy.
Kuro: [as he gets up] Byako...?
Kuro: Hold on! So you knew about that giant thing?
Gen: Of course, he was your real test.
Kuro: Wha- Are you serious?! So what was with the statue then?! You had me trying to break a pointless statue for 6 years!? 6 WHOLE YEARS!?
Gen: Calm down it wasn’t for nothing. That “pointless statue” is what toughened you up all this time.
Kuro: But how? Why did that Tiger thing show up? ... and what does the statue have to do with it? 
Gen: Byako doesn’t just show himself to anyone. You need to prove you’re even worthy enough... by showing that you’ve tapped into your spirit pool.
Kuro: S-.. spirit pool? The hell are you talking about?
Gen: Trying to explain to you is a waste of breath.
Kuro: Ya know, sometimes I wonder how I managed to learn anything from you.
Gen: All you need to worry about is you’ve opened up your pool of spirit energy. With that, even you can be useful!
Kuro: Wow thanks Gen I feel so accomplished.
[Change scene to them inside, eating dinner or something]
Kuro: Okay I think I get it now... that statue you had me trying to break for years couldn’t be broken by just pure strength and I had to learn to unlock my spirit energy and use that power to break it but instead the spirit of the statue reacted to my spirit energy and appeared from the statue to attack me in order to test my abilities and I think I somehow used my spirit energy to be able to control the fire that giant tiger was throwing at me and that’s how I could overcome his attacks and beat him! Did I get that right......
[camera pan to gen giving no fucks and not listening]
Kuro: I’ll just take that as a yes.
Kuro: So...? what is this... spirit energy.
Gen: I’m not your personal dictionary, go figure it out yourself.
Kuro: Seriously, how did I ever let you become my teacher?
Gen: Spirit energy is something you have to learn completely on your own. There’s no point in telling you anything about it.
Kuro: On my own? Why can’t you just tell me how you learned it?
Gen: Everyone’s spirit energy is different. Like I said, your power is for you to figure out on your own.
Kuro: Greaaaaaat, just like eeevrything elseee 
Kuro: Then...at least tell me what your power is!
Gen: My power lets me not have to listen to your noisy ass every day... Or at least I wish it was.
Kuro: Gee Gen, that was hilarious. How long it’d take to come up with that one?
Gen: Not as long as your training took.
Kuro: You shut up!
Gen: [Drink some tea] You may be able to access your spirit energy now, but it’ll be useless to you.
Kuro: Oh yeah? Why’s that, old maaan.
Gen: Well, you just unlocked it. You have no idea how to control it. You’d just be wasting your energy.
Kuro: [Extremely unenthusiastically] So... lemme guess, more training?
Gen: Nothing comes easy in life kid. I’m sure you know that by now.
Kuro: Yeah yeah when do we start...
Gen: Tomorrow. Be ready.
Kuro: [Not taking it seriously] As ready as always...
Gen: Listen, you’re almost there. Don’t lose heart now.
Kuro: Dont worry... It’d be a waste of 6 years if I did...
Kuro: [Remember when he activated the spirit powers, thinking to himself] That strange feeling I got before the Tiger Spirit appeared... what was that...?

Scene 3
[A few days later, Kuro has is practicing his fire control, quick training sequence here]
[Scene starts with a view of the afternoon sky, kuro’s shoutings (hah! Hmph!) can be heard from a distance]
Kuro: Damn it come on!!!
Kuro: HAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH~
[kuro finally makes a tiny fire]
Kuro: [Excited, pleased with himself] Heeeee!y! I’ve finally got it!!!!
Kuro: Gen look! I did it! Isn’t it awesome!?
Gen: Wow.
[gen is not impressed]
Kuro: SO this... this is my spirit power...
Gen: Don’t pat yourself on the back too much there. You’ve only started to get the hang of it.
Kuro: [Sighs] Great... So what’s next?
Gen: Go boil me some tea, standing here watching you fail all day made me tired.
Kuro: [Annoyed] I’m not your damn errand boy Gen now stop messing around and tell me what’s next!
[Gen turns and looks up or some shit. Dramatic pause]
Gen: [Sigh] I’ve got nothing left to teach you. As of now, you’ve graduated from my training.... finally.
Kuro: [Excitedly] Y-You’re kidding!
Kuro: It’s about damn time! [looks down to his hands, confirming it to himself] I’ve grown a lot since that day, haven’t I?
Gen: You’ve grown from an absolute pile of crap to a kid with some survival skills, congratulations.
Kuro: When will you give me some credit, Gen?!
Gen: Maybe when you’re strong enough to take me on.
Kuro: Fine, one day I’ll come back and beat the HELL outa you!
Gen: Right, I’ll look forward to it. If you do, I might even have one final secret to teach you.
Kuro: I thought you said you had nothing left to teach me!
Gen: Maybe, maybe not. You’ll have to bring me down to find out.
Kuro: [punches fist] Why don’t I just take you down now huh!?
Kuro: And I’m going to enjoy every last minute of it you damn old man.
Gen: Don’t get too excited about it yet, you’ve still got a long way to go.
Gen: Now if you’ll excuse me I’ve got better things to do than babysit you any longer than I have to.
Kuro: [Sarcastically] Yea Yeah I’m sure you do. 
[Gen walks away]
Kuro: [looks serious off to a direction] I should head “there” one last time...
Gen: [pauses, takes deep breath maybe?] Alright. Enough screwing around. There’s one last thing we need to talk about.
Gen: [Becomes serious] Come. Follow me.
Kuro: Hey where are you-
[Gen and Kuro arrive back to Kuro’s home land, destroyed in ruins]
[Kuro stares in silence, remembering his past]
Kuro: Aonix Village... that’s right... 6 years ago I lived here, before I met Gen...
Gen: I know it’s not easy being here, but I wanted you to come back to this place one more time... before you head out.
Gen: I want you to remember why you came to me to train in the first place. What are you fighting for. Think on that.
Kuro: [Serious] I do.
Gen: Figured you’d be here.
[Kuro turns around]
Gen: Yo.
Gen: So...? What’s your plans?
Kuro: My plan...? 
Kuro: Idunno.. [pulls out shard] all I’ve got to go on is this black shard... whatever it is... but we know Ekktanian soldiers were here so ... maybe they’re connected.
Gen: I doubt a soldier that attacked your village will just happily answer your questions. You’re still a Chrotian, after all. And you know how most humans feel about your kind...
Kuro: [With a scary look] I have to try... I’ll make them give me answers...
Gen: [Stares at kuro for a while] Hey kid. Take this from me personally. If revenge is what you’re after, just give it up now.
Kuro: [looks down and doesn’t answer]...
Gen: I didn’t pick you up and train you all this time to help you get back at humans. Do the wrong things and you’ll just make things even harder for yourself. 
Kuro: [Reluctantly] Yeah... 
Gen: I just hope you won’t do something you’ll regret.
Gen: I get the feeling one day, you’ll fight against yourself. I hope I’m wrong.
Kuro: Fight... against myself?
Gen: You’ll know when it comes. Just be ready for it. You have 6 years of training under your belt.
Kuro: Yeah, I will!
Gen: [sigh] But... Knowing that it’s you, you’ll probably end up doing some good out there.
Kuro: Wow that’s new, hearing something almost nice from you for a change?
Gen: [Ignores that last comment, sighs] Don’t get used to it. It’s getting late, I’m heading back. 
Kuro: Yeah... I need to start packing soon...
Gen: If you’re not ready and gone by tomorrow I’m throwing you out myself.
Kuro: Heh sure.
[Shot of Kuro getting ready to leave, standing in front of the temple, firm and strong and determined]
Kuro: It’s finally time...!
Gen: Good riddance! I better not see you back here any time soon.
Kuro: Yeah yeah, just don’t miss me too much okay?
Gen: I’d sooner kill myself!
Kuro: Ya know Gen, one day I’m gonna get you back for all the crap you give me.
Gen: Exciting I’ll look forward to it.
Kuro: Well, this is it! Thanks for everything Gen, I mean it!
Gen: Now go show the world what you’re made of, Kuro. 
Kuro: You bet!!
[Kuro and Gen exchange one last look of grattitude as Kuro leaves]
Scene 4
[A while later, at night]
Kuro: [Sigh, slightly out of breath]... Traveling the world... Much easier said than done huh.
[Kuro looks up to the sky, sees the moon]
Kuro: Maybe I’ll just call it a night soon.
Kuro: Hm?
[Kuro is just surprised and confused, not knowing if that thing is a friend or foe, he’s not cautious of it yet]
Kuro: Wha- what’s that?
[feeling a bad aura from it and the look of its eyes, NOW he’s cautious]
[the black things slowly approach kuro]
Kuro: Never seen a creature like that before...
Kuro: Hey-
[Creature shrieks at kuro]
[The black things jump at kuro]
Kuro: What the hell!?
Kuro: Hey what’s your problem!? What’d I do to you!?
[Creature just growls at kuro]
[Overview shot of them 2, silence]
Kuro: I dunno why I bother.
[Creature steps forward]
[kuro drops his bag]
Kuro: [Sigh] Doesn’t look like it’s going to stop. So let’s do this.
[Creature charges at kuro attack, throws some attacks and Kuro dodges]
Kuro: You asked for it!
[Kuro does a combo, knocks creature away]
Kuro: How’s that!? Last chance to run if you don’t want to get hurt!
[Creature continues to attack]
Kuro:... Guess not.
[more fight scenes]
[As kuro does a few more hits, a second creature comes out and sneaks up behind kuro, lands a hit]
Kuro: You serious?! is that even legal!?
Kuro: Where are these guys coming from? And what even are they...?
Kuro: Did someone send them? Could it be from the humans? 
Kuro: Whatever they’re after, I better be careful. Who knows what they can do...
[both creatures attack in unison]
Kuro: Fine, I’ll take you both on! Let’s go!

[Real fight begins]

[At one point the creatures kick up sand to blind an unexpecting kuro, and both send a dark pulse into kuro]
[Kuro uses his fire power to knock them both away]
Kuro: What the hell was that!? 
Kuro: That could have been dangerous... I need to stop fooling around before they get me for real!
Kuro: Alright! Now let’s see if all that stupid training with Gen was worth it!
[The black things start to disappear]
Kuro: [Tired but trying to act tough] What.... over already...?
Kuro: [Confused] So, what was that...? Why were they after me...?
Kuro: Hmm...? What’s this?
Kuro: 
[Flash back of childhood, of the day Kuro met Eos]
[fade to black. a pair of eyes open up]
